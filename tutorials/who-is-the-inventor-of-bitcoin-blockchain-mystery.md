description: Who is the founder/inventor of bitcoin and blockchain technology? Who is Satoshi Nakamoto and what is the mystery surrounding him?

Bitcoin and cyrptocurrency has certainly created a buzz in the tech circles in the past 2-3 years. It's also created several multi-millionaries and certainly lead to several people losing their entire life savings betting large on Bitcoin. So who exactly invented/created bitcoin or blockchain?

### Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin/blockchain
The answer is simple, but, mysterious. The credit to creating bitcoin goes to a person named Satoshi Nakamoto who emerged from the wilderness and published a paper titled [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System]("https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf") that laid down the under-lying technology of blockchain, double-spending problem, time-stamp servers, etc. There were earlier papers on the proof-of-work concept, but Satoshi's paper gave a clear explanation how things work and it became the backbone of bitcoin and other altcoins. Nobody really knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is - whether that is a real person's name, if it is a pseudonym, male/female, nationality - nothing really is known about Satoshi. But, the paper he published had a great impact on the tech world as we know it and it spawned the blockchain and bitcoin revolution.

If you search hard on Google, you'll find articles from investigative journalists who claim that Satoshi was active on the bitcointalk forums under the name "satoshi", that he worked only during a certain part of the day, etc. Here is a link to his profile on [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3). 

### Any other claims?
* In December 2013, a blogger named Skye Grey claimed that the computer scientist Nick Szabo wrote the Bitcoin white paper, but Szabo denied any links to the paper or being Satoshi.
* Then in 2016, an Australian named Craig Wright told the BBC that he was the creator of the controversial digital currency. After the itnerview, Craig was pressed for proof, but he could not give any documents or technological trail to prove that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. 

But, you know the cool part about all of this? Nobody knows the founder or blockchain/bitcoin, he published a single article - the whole world lapped it up and his invention is creating waves in a de-centralised way. That is the real take-away from this story!
Do you know who Satoshi Nakamoto is?
