### CryptoChainary aims at being a one-stop resource for blockchain and bitcoin technology.

I am a generally curious person who can juggle several different things at the same time. I've been an engineer, R&D scientist, and currently a Product Manager at a video startup. 

My goal is learn and help people learn about blockchain technology which can truly transform certain aspects of the industry as we know it. I am always on the lookout for new and interesting applications of blockchain technology - so if you want to exchange ideas or simply get it touch, please send me an email or [contact me](https://cryptochainery.github.io/contact/) and let's get talking.

Thank you!
